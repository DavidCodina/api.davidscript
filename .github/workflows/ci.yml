  # Pull Request from contributors that forked will not occur automatically, but instead require approval.
  # Why? Because obviously you don't want to automatically deploy from forked users.
  # By default, pull requests based on forks do not trigger workflows.
  # First-time contributors must be approved manually. Subsequent PRs will be triggered
  # automatically. That said, if you add a collaborator and they do a first PR, it will
  # trigger automatially on the first time.
